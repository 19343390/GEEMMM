# MMM_v4.1
Mangrove Mapping Methodology v4.1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Included in this software package is a set scripts that are to be used in the 
Google Earth Engine environment (https://earthengine.google.com/). The developed 
tool is meant to be used to mapmangroves around the would, using the Landsat 
program imagery, the random forest classifier, and user-derived classification 
reference data. The Google Earth Engine Mangrove Mapping Methodology was 
developed with funding from Blue Ventures Conservation 
(https://blueventures.org/), with a pilot study currently under reveiw to be 
published in the Journal of Remote Sensing
(https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing).

CONTACT

If there are discovered bugs or issues with the code, or with the directions on
how to use is, you can contact Dr. Trevor Jones:

WEBSITE

The funding for this open source mangrove mapping tool was provided by Blue
Ventures Conservation. You may learn more about BVC at:

OPERATION

The 3 main scripts can be directly copied into the GEE environment. Once saved 
as localscripts, they should be able to executed. The module scripts do not 
need to be copied and saved locally, but they are included in this repository 
for user reference.

The data inputs for the GEEMMM have both internal and external source options,
however, to perform the classification, classification reference data must be 
provided. Because of the unique nature of land cover classifications, this must
be provided by the user. A process to create CRD in GEE is provided here by 
Google:
